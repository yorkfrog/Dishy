## This is a learning project ##
One of the main aims of this project has been to learn more about C++ and the Sloeber/Eclipse Arduino environment.  

As such, it uses a ridiculously over-engineered class hieracrchy for an embedded system.  No one in their right mind would use such a scheme for a 'real' project.  The same behaviour could be achieved with a fraction of the code and probably an order of magnitude less memory using more traditional C/C++ embedded techniques.

*Please don't judge me!!!!* :D

Enjoy the ridiculousness!
